# README - Phase 5 Project Guidelines

## Learning Goals

- Final capstone project for Flatiron School Software Dev Program - November 21st, 2022 Cohort

## Summary

- JINDAH (Jobs I Need Done at Home) - An app for people everywhere who are screaming: "these are the jobs I need done at home!"

- JINDAH allows users to sign up as users and add properties and jobs needed done on those properites. It also allows a user to sign up as a contractor and "accept" those jobs. The app allows users to comment on jobs to suggest contractors or other ideas.

- Live Example here: https://jindah-app.onrender.com/ (this seems to load very slow on the free deployment site, render.com)
